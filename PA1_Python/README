Overview:
 wf.py is a word counting program. The script takes a text file and count the number of words (including digits).
 The results are then printed to standard out.

Included files:
 The following files are included.
 wf.py - the driver program
 practice - directory containing sample/test files

Building & Running:
 All files and folders should be in the same directory.
 To run the program simply issue the following:
 
 python wf.py <file>

Program Design:
 wf.py is relatively. It takes the specified file and opens it.
 While the file is open, it goes through it line by line. It cleans
 up (remove punctuations) then splits it apart by space. Each word,
 along with its count is then placed in the dictionary.

Program Development & Testing:
//TODO complete me
